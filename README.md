# WebPrisma: An Interactive Web-Based Tool for Exploratory Visualization Using Multiple Coordinated Views
This is the final front-end source code of my master thesis, presented in **December, 2009**, at Federal University of Pará State, PA - Brazil (Universidade Federal do Pará).
The back-end source code isn't available because it is proprietary source from [Gol Software](http://www.golsoftware.com.br){:target="_blank"} company.

### Abstract
This work presents a web-based information visualization tool that supports
multiple coordinated views. Multiple views allow the users to better analyze data on
different perspectives while coordination facilitates the analysis of the relationship
between those views.
The tool uses three visualization techniques: scatterplot, treemap and parallel
coordinates. It supports the main requisites of a good visualization tool: overview,
details on demand, selection and filter. It also supports brushing. The prototype
automatically generates the user interface according to metadata stored on a server. The
asynchronous communication is based on the AJAX technique. The Java server
application delivers to the web-client the final rendered images associated to each view.

**Keywords:** information visualization, web, multiple coordinated views
